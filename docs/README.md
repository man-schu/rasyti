This application is based on WebTypist version 1, see credits below. Since then, a lot of further languages and lessons have been added.

The word "rašyti" is Lithuanian and means "to write". The reason why I chose the name is simply that Lithuanian was the first language that I added.



## Credits

Credits to <a href="https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webtypist">WebTypist (Github)</a>, version 1, for providing the original engine. Version 2 of that engine shuffles words randomly which is handy for single words but makes offering whole sentences impossible.

Credits also to the <a href="https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.ktouch">ktouch</a> project for providing some lessons.

Credits to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> to provide a lot of material that can be used as excercises.

Last and not least to mention that the project would not be possible without the precious remarks from users.

A working release is available here: https://www.blueseal.eu/rasyti/ and here: https://man-schu.github.io/rasyti/.
