This application is based on WebTypist version 1, see credits below. Since then, a lot of further languages and lessons have been added.

The word "rašyti" is Lithuanian and means "to write". The reason why I chose the name is simply that Lithuanian was the first language that I added.

## To do

Work on the Electron based desktop release:

1. Do not open Develper Tools on startup. Otherwise it works fine. It is rather a cosmectical problem.
2. Add icon to the binary.
